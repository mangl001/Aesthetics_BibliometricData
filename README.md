### Data for analysis 1: Aesthetics as a whole
* For the analysis using Vosviewer (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010), we provide a folder with all "text" files downloaded from Web of Science (a total of 27169 publications).
* For the analysis using the R package Bibliometrix (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017), we provide a "bib" file with the same publications.

This data was retrieved from Web of Science on July 18, 2019.

### Data for analysis 2: Differences between academic research areas
We organised the data according to the six research areas: 
* Arts & Humanities (A&H), 
* Life Sciences & Biomedicine (LS&B), 
* Psychology (P), 
* Physical Sciences (PS), 
* Social Sciences (SS), and 
* Technology (T).

In each research area, we provide the "text" files and the single "bib" file as described above.
